## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do :Function 1 -- makeCacheMatrix()----it creates a 
## special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse.
## Function 2 -- cacheSolve()----it computes the inverse of the “matrix”
## returned by makeCacheMatrix(). If the inverse has already been calculated
## and the matrix has not changed, it’ll retrieve the inverse from the cache
## directly.
## Function 3 -- test()----takes in any invertible matrix, calculates its inverse
## twice using the above functions, and prints out the times it takes for both runs.
## The first run should take longer than the second because it actually calculates 
## the inverse while the second run only does a look-up from the cache.

## FUNCTION 1

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
inv = NULL
set = function(y) {
x <<- y
inv <<- NULL
}
get = function() x
setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inv
getinv = function() inv
list(set = set, get = get, setinv = setinv, getinv = getinv)

}


## FUNCTION 2

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
inv = x$getinv()
if(!is.null(inv)){
message("getting cached data")
return(inv)
}
mat.data = x$get()
inv = solve(mat.data,...)
x$setinv(inv)
return(inv)
}

## FUNCTION 3

test = function(mat){
temp = makeCacheMatrix(mat)
start.time = Sys.time()
cacheSolve(temp)
dur = Sys.time() - start.time
print(dur)
start.time = Sys.time()
cacheSolve(temp)
dur = Sys.time() - start.time
print(dur)
}

### Sample output as an example after sourcing the above file into R console ::
### Input lines typed by us in the R console :-
##  source("xyz.R")     ('xyz' being the placeholder for the R file name in the working directory)
##  set.seed(1110201)
##  r = rnorm(1000000)
##  mat1 = matrix(r, nrow=1000, ncol=1000)
##  test(mat1)

### Output that we get :-
##  Time difference of 't1' secs
##  Time difference of 't2' secs
## We notice that t2<t1 i.e.; the first run takes longer than the second 
## because it actually calculates the inverse while the second run only.
